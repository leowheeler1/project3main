## Project Overview
  - For this project we wanted to synthesize COVID-19 data and Mental Health data to see what kind of correlations, if any, we could find. Some of the questions we sought to answer were:
      - What states saw the most COVID cases?
      - Were any other illnesses prominent in these areas as well?
      - What demographics are most impacted by anxiety and depression?
      - What trends exist between states?
      - How do the areas most impacted by COVID cases and anxiety/depression compare?
  - We decided to use an API and convert a JSON response for the initial data and converted that into a .csv file, which was then converted into a PostgresQL database. In addition to this, we have a README.md file which contains a content overview, we used Github Pages to make an interactive set of visualizations,  and Javascript as well as HTML/CSS to run these visualizations. Psycopg2 was used to take information from PostgresQL through Python into a JSON to our interactive visualizations. Last but not least we also decided to use D3 and Plotly to further increase the power of our visualizations.
  - Overall, this data analytics project is condensed by its work: we extracted the data from various websites cited in References, transformed it into a SQL database, and then loaded it into Javascript/HTML/CSS powered interactive visualizations to increase ease of access for client side usage.

## Instructions

## Ethical Considerations
  - For this project, we used data from the CDC. We ourselves are not interfering with any end user licensing agreements nor are we stealing data that we should not have access to. This data has been sourced ethically from public spaces and is being used for educational purposes. 
  - Additionally notable are the CDC Guidelines for Data Sharing and Collections, cited in Other References. The CDC follows ten principles that bolster 5 standards to keep their data practices sharp and up to code. They are:
      - Public health data should be acquired, used, disclosed, and stored for legitimate public health purposes.
      - Programs should collect the minimum amount of personally identifiable information necessary to conduct public health activities.
      - Programs should have strong policies to protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable data.
      - Data collection and use policies should reflect respect for the rights of individuals and community groups and minimize undue burden.
      - Programs should have policies and procedures to ensure the quality of any data they collect or use.
      - Programs have the obligation to use and disseminate summary data to relevant stakeholders in a timely manner.
      - Programs should share data for legitimate public health purposes and may establish data-use agreements to facilitate sharing data in a timely manner.
      - Public health data should be maintained in a secure environment and transmitted through secure methods.
      - Minimize the number of persons and entities granted access to identifiable data.
      - Program officials should be active, responsible stewards of public health data.

  - In conclusion, this data is ethically sourced and maintained.
